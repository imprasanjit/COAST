						<h5 class="page-title text-left">What is a CAA?</h5>
						<p>CAA is the acronym of Coastal Aquaculture Authority. It
							defines the Coastal area as “the area of land within a distance
							of two kilometers from the High Tide Line (HTL) of seas, river,
							creeks and backwaters”</p>
						<h5 class="page-title text-left">What is a leased pond?</h5>
						<p>If any aquaculture pond is registered under the Fisheries
							Dept. then that pond will be referred as a Leased Pond.</p>
						<h5 class="page-title text-left">What is a feasible Govt.
							land?</h5>
						<p>If a Govt. land is outside CRZ and and other regulatory
							boundary then it comes under the Feasible Govt. land.</p>
						<h5 class="page-title text-left">Aquaculture ponds outside
							CAA needs permission from Fisheries Dept. or not?</h5>
						<p>To be given by Fisheries Dept.</p>
						<h5 class="page-title text-left">What is the mapping year of
							aquaculture ponds?</h5>
						<p>2017-18.</p>
						<h5 class="page-title text-left">What is CRZ?</h5>
						<p>CRZ is the acronym for Coastal Regulation Zone. As per the
							CRZ notification, 2019, the land area from High Tide Line (HTL)
							to 500 meters on the landwards side along the sea front.</p>
						<p>Explanation: For the purposes of this notification, the HTL
							means the line on the land up to which the highest water line
							reaches during the spring tide, as demarcated by the National
							Centre For Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) in accordance
							with the laid down procedures and made available to various
							coastal States and Union territories.</p>
						<p>CRZ shall apply to the land area between HTL to 50 meters
							or width of the creek, whichever is less on the landward side
							along the tidal influenced water bodies that are connected to the
							sea and the distance up to which development along such tidal
							influenced water bodies is to be regulated shall be governed by
							the distance up to which the tidal effects are experienced which
							shall be determined based on salinity concentration of five parts
							per thousand (ppt) measured during the driest period of the year
							ad distance up to which tidal effects are experienced shall be
							clearly identified and demarcated accordingly in the Coastal Zone
							Management Plan(hereinafter referred to as the CZMP). For details
							of the notification, the MoEF &amp; CC website may be visited.</p>
						<h5 class="page-title text-left">What are the categories of
							CRZ?</h5>
						<p>As per the CRZ Notification 2011, CRZ I consists of CRZ IA
							and IB. CRA IA areas are ecologically sensitive and the
							geomorphological features which play a role in the maintaining

							constitute CRZ-III, and CRZ-III shall be further classified into
							following categories:</p>
						<p>
							<strong>CRZ-IIIA</strong>
						</p>
						<p>Such densely populated CRZ-III areas, where the population
							density is more than 2161 per square kilometer as per 2011 census
							base, shall be designated as CRZ-IIIA and in CRZ-IIIA, area up to
							50 meters from the HTL on the landward side shall be earmarked as
							the ‘No Development Zone (NDZ)’, provided the CZMP as per this
							notification , framed with due consultative process, have been
							approved, failing which, a NDZ of 200 meters shall continue to
							apply.</p>
						<p>

							LTL on the other side of the bank, extending from the mouth of
							the water body at the sea up to the influence of tide. i.e.,
							salinity of five parts per thousand (ppt) during the spring tide.
						</p>
						<h5 class="page-title text-left">What area the CRZ Regulation

						<p>
							<strong>Demarcation of Ecologically Sensitive Areas
								(ESA)</strong>
						</p>
						<p>National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM),
							Chennai has been awarded the task of mapping ESAs by MoEF&amp;CC.
							The task was undertaken in partnership with various expert
							agencies. Mangroves, sand dunes, sea grass, mudflat and salt
							marsh ecosystems have been mapped using aerial photographs and
							satellite images by NCSCM. Final maps of ESAs prepared by NCSCM
							in collaboration with various agencies were used to prepare the
							CRZ IA area.</p>
